Timing data:
    All of these numbers are gathered using the time command
    The inputs are 10/4/4 (generations, pred mutations, prey mutations)

== Just using python's random ===
real    13m52.276s
user    13m40.075s
sys 0m7.304s

== A little speed up using numpy's random ==
real    12m50.851s
user    12m41.560s
sys 0m4.048s


=== Using more precise measurements == 
Total time: 742
	Generation 0 took 1% of the total time
		Masking took 88% of the total generation time
		Scoring took 11% of the total generation time
	Generation 1 took 2% of the total time
		Masking took 90% of the total generation time
		Scoring took 8% of the total generation time
	Generation 2 took 4% of the total time
		Masking took 93% of the total generation time
		Scoring took 6% of the total generation time
	Generation 3 took 5% of the total time
		Masking took 95% of the total generation time
		Scoring took 4% of the total generation time
	Generation 4 took 7% of the total time
