<a NAME="bsumm"><h4>I.Brief Summary</h4></a>(excerpt from the design document)
	Dr. Debonis suggested this idea to us. It is known as a &quot;Predator &amp; Prey Simulation&quot;.
Basically, there is a world and two types of organisms known as predators and prey. 
Their goals in life are to live as long as possible, and to survive each organism
type must eat. Predators eat prey, and prey eat plants. The world where these
organisms exist is made up of tiles. Imagine a sphere made of hexagonal shaped tiles.
Each and every hexagonal tile represents a location in the world. The simulation
will run in generations made up of turn-based rounds. After each generation finishes,
the best organism of each category, predator and prey, will be saved for the next generation. 
The current generation consists of organisms having characteristics similar to the best
organisms of the previous generation but with mutations, and the best of the previous 
generation again. After that new generation has run through its rounds, the best will be
taken again, and the cycle shall repeat.

<a NAME="howto"><h4>II.How to use this program</h4></a>
Once the program window is open you will see areas to:</pre><font face="Courier New" size="1.5">
<ul><li>Left area</li>
	<ul><li>Input the number of generations</li>
		<li>Input the number of predators per generation</li>
		<li>Input the number of prey per generation</li>
		<li>Adjust how much of the map is filled with predators</li>
		<li>Adjust how much of the map is filled with prey</li>
		<li>Adjust how much of the map is filled with vegetation</li>
		<li>Adjust how many of the pdf's are mutated each generation</li>
		<li>Apply the mutation</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Right area</li>
	<ul><li>Legend</li>
		<li>Adjust the speed of the current round's progress</li>
		<li>Adjust the size of the map</li>
		<li>Run the animation</li>
	</ul>
</font></ul><pre>
If you do not wish to adjust anything and simply run the program, there are default
values set, so you may simply click mutate and/or animate.

Note: If you are typing into one of the input fields (number of predators per generation,
number of prey per generation, number of generations, size of map) and your keystrokes are
not doing anything, you are probably typing invalid input otherwise known as things that
aren't numbers. The program automatically checks if you are properly entering valid data.

<a NAME="techinfo"><h4>III.Technical Information</h4></a>
This program was written in the Python programming language, version 2.6.
It is designed to take advantage of multi-core machines, due to some of the
calculations being extremely intensive.

Installation Instructions
On Windows:
	Please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
	Click the first link, "Python 2.6.5 Windows installer"
	Download it, follow the instructions
	Double click the blah.py file to start the program

On Linux:
	Open a terminal
	Type "sudo-apt get install python" without the "'s
	Type "python blah.py"

On Mac:
	Noooo noo no...

<a NAME="faqs"><h4>IV.FAQ's</h4></a>
Here are some common questions answered...
<ol>
  <li>What does this program do?</li>
	This program simulates the relationship between predators and prey and the process
	of evolution.
  <li>What are some important concepts?</li>
	Organism/Critter = a predator or a prey
	Vegetation/Plant/Shrub = food that prey eat
	World/Map = the representation of the world, made of hexagons
	Hierarchy of the program:
		Whole Program
			Generation - made up of rounds
				Round - made up of turns, the simulation is turn-based after all
					Turn
  <li>What "things" are on the map?</li>
	"Things" can be divided into types of organisms and vegetation. There are two types of
	organisms: predators and prey. Vegetation represent non-critter food.
  <li>What do predators eat?</li>
	Prey.
  <li>What do prey eat?</li>
	Vegetation.
  <li>What is vegetation?</li>
	Vegetation is meant to represent food that prey eat, such as plants and shrubs.
	Vegetation does not move or evolve, but it depletes as it is eaten by prey.
  <li>What eats predators?</li>
	Nothing.
  <li>Can one type of organism eat the other type of organism's food as well?</li>
	No.
  <li>Does cannibalism exist in this program?</li>
	No.
  <li>How do predators and prey decide how to behave?</li>
	Predators and prey each look at the world around them and get sensory data
	(i.e. direction of nearest predator, distance of nearest predator, direction
	of nearest prey, distance of nearest prey, etc.). Based on the sensory data
	they currently have, they look at a pdf, a probability density function. Based
	on the percentages in that pdf, they execute the chosen action.
  <li>Err....What?</li>
	Organisms basically take in sensory data, and based on that data they make a decision
	on what to do.

	Ok first take a deep breath. Good? Now then, let's take a very simplified example. 
	Pretend that you have an organism, a prey, that has only two kinds of sensory data:

	Direction of nearest vegetation: 0-1
	Distance of nearest vegetation: 0-1
	(these values can only be 0 or 1 here)

	Because the organism has only two kinds of sensory data that it can detect
	there is a square (a 2 by 2 figure) with four pdf's in it at the corners. At each of the
	corners of the square there is a pdf, represented by a histogram (basically a vertical bar
	graph). The histogram at the top left has let's say 3 bars, the left bar representing "move
	top left" and has a height of 0.2, the middle bar representing "move left" and has a height
	of 0.3, and the right bar representing "don't move anywhere" and has a 	height of 0.5. In a
	pdf, the sum of the heights of the bars in its histogram must add up to 1. The histograms
	at each of the corners of the square have three bars as well that add up to 1, but the 
	height of each bar is different. Therefore the square represents all the possible
	combinations of sensory input. Remember that our hexagonal shaped tiles have only 7 possible
	valid moves: top left, top right, right, bottom right, bottom left, left, and don't move.
	Also remember that this a simplified example.

	00---01
	|     |
	10---11

	Ok, so now let's say that the sensory input data is 0 for direction of nearest vegetation, and
	0 for distance of nearest vegetation. The histogram at the top left of the square is looked at.
	

	0.5			     ||
	                             ||
	0.3		||           ||
			||	     ||
	0.2_||__________||___________||____
	   top left    left      no moving
	
	The program then takes a weighted choice of which action to execute. While there is a chance that
	ANY of the actions may get executed, the MOST LIKELY one the get executed is the action with the
	largest bar, in this case "don't move anywhere" will most likely get chosen.

  <li>Was that ASCII art?</li>
	Oh yeah.
