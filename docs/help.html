(excerpt from the design document)
	Dr. Debonis suggested this idea to us. It is known as a &quot;Predator &amp; Prey Simulation&quot;.
Basically, there is a world and two types of organisms known as predators and prey. 
Their goals in life are to live as long as possible, and to survive each organism type must eat.
Predators eat prey, and prey eat plants. The world where these organisms exist is made up of tiles.
Imagine a sphere made of hexagonal shaped tiles. Each and every hexagonal tile represents a location in the world. 
The simulation will run in generations made up of turn-based rounds. 
After each generation finishes, the best organism of each category, predator and prey, will be saved for the next generation. 
The current generation consists of organisms having characteristics similar to the best organisms of 
the previous generation but with mutations, and the best of the previous generation again.
After that new generation has run through its rounds, the best will be taken again, and the cycle shall repeat.
